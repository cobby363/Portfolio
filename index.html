									<p>This is a small selection of my projects that I have worked on as a part<br />
									of college, professionally and also in my own time. Some are individual and some were a<br />
									sucessful team effort. Most of the games that I have made thus far have been built in Unity <br />
									I am in the process of learning the Unreal Engine at the moment and I am enjoying it! I plan <br />
									to upload projects created in this as I continue to learn.

									<p>This is my first attempt at creating a game in the Unreal engline. I have made use of Nanites and Lumens to give the game a more realistic feel. There are of course many things I wish to improve upon but I spent a lot of time experimenting with features and loved the experience. I plan to add to this game over time with new features! Currently includes custom sounds, animations, obstacles and more!</p>
