									<h1>About Me</h1>

								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/profile.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I'm Cathal O'Brien, born and raised in the county of Wexford in the South East of Ireland but have been Living in Waterford since I started studying in Waterford Institute of Technology in September of 2018. Before all of this I had been playing rugby for most of my life and had started to have quite a bit of success. At the start of the season in which I joined college, I injured my thumb which along with time has kept me out of the sport ever since. I'm 20 years old now and I'm ready to push on to hopefully have a successful career in the gams development industry constantly learning along the way.</p>
								<p>During my time at college I have studies a huge range of subjects including Maths, Physics, cryptography, programming and of course many elements of games development, amongst others. In terms of the games development subjects studies were 2D games development, 3D game assets, Introduction to 3D Game Development and Introduction to Game Design. Currently finishing my second year of studies I still have more to cover and look forward to the challenge of it all. The course I'm studying is BSc (Hons) Entertainment System specialising in Games development. I have been using Unity to develop games from the beginning but I also do plan to try out using the unreal engine soon in order to get a more well rounded understanding of the development using multiple engines and to see how my skills can transfer over.</p>
								<p>Thanks for taking the time out to learn a little about me, if you happen to hav any questions be sure to contact me on any of the means listed below.
