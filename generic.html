									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Cathal O'Brien</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Me3.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My name's Cathal O'Brien, born and raised in the county of Wexford in the South East of Ireland, I have been Living in Waterford since I started studying in The South East Technological University in Ireland in September of 2018 and I graduated in the year 2022 with a first class honours degree (1.1) with an overall GPA of 72.3.  I'm 23 years old now and I'm ready to push on to hopefully have a successful career in the games development industry constantly learning along the way.</p>
								<p>During my time at college I have studies a huge range of subjects including Maths, Physics, cryptography, programming, web development, databases and of course many elements of game development, amongst others. In terms of the games development specific subjects I've studied include; 2D game development, 3D game assets, Introduction to 3D Game Development, Introduction to C++ for Games , Games development Practicum, Game Development in C++, Introduction to Game Design, Mobile game development and Advanced 3D games development.</p>
								<p>As mentioned, I have completed my final year of college and I look forward to all the challenges that will come next. The course I studied was a BSc (Hons) Entertainment System specialising in Games development. I have been using Unity to develop games from the beginning, but I also have a bit of experience with the unreal engine. I plan to learn more on this engine and in C++/Blueplint development soon in order to get a more well rounded understanding of the development using multiple engines and to see how my skills can transfer over. I have worked in the industry with a company by the name of ZenLand Games. I worked on their first project 'Ekoh Beach.' I initially started working with them on work experience in Feb 2021. My contract got extended and I finished working in October 2021 in order to focus on my final year of college</p>
								<p>In the past, in my free time I was a Rugby player. I have played the sport for 13 years of my life. I stopped playing rugby when I came into first year of college due to a thumb injury that has kept me out of the sport. I will consider going back in the future though now that it has healed some more. In college I have been playing for and running the table tennis club. I've coached and organised to play in the 2022 intervarsities. This is the first time WIT have competed in this competition so it is something I am very proud of. </p>
								<p>Thanks for taking the time out to learn a little about me, if you happen to have any questions be sure to contact me via any of the means listed below. </p>
